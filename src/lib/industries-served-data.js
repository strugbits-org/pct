        detail: `Due to the advances in automotive technology, modern vehicles are relying more and more on sophisticated computers and electronic systems to function properly. Providing protective conformal coating for sensitive electronic assemblies and complex components in automobiles have become increasingly necessary. The automotive industry routinely turns to Parylene coatings to provide enhanced protection for all kinds of electronic circuitry.
 
        Parylene coating forms an ultra-thin polymer layer on almost any surface, penetrating every crevice and providing a uniform coat that is unequaled by any other coating material. Parylene creates a protective, nonconductive dielectric layer that’s added to a circuit board or electronic device. Parylene conformal coatings provide a superior pinhole-free, uniform barrier to protect against dust, moisture, corrosion, chemicals, solvents, fumes, extreme temperatures and more.
        ​
        Vehicles will continue to trend in a more computerized direction as the years go by. Therefore, automotive companies need high-tech electronics to perform for decades inside their vehicles. Parylene is well-suited for applications that may be used in harsh automotive environments. `,

        Parylene coating offers excellent crevice penetration, ideal barrier and insulating properties, high thermal and UV stability. Parylene guards against humidity, pressure, temperature, and other environment variables. Parylene film is resistant to moisture, salt spray and chemically inert; no acid or alkaline material will attack it in any significant manner.
        Parylene is considered by many to be the ultimate conformal coating for the protection of devices, complex components and electronic surfaces. Due to the fact that Parylene is vapor deposited in a vacuum, its coating materials provide outstanding protective properties and give the best possible coverage.  `,

Parylene coatings protect a variety of rubber and elastomeric components ranging from gaskets and seals, to keypads and medical catheters. Medical grade silicone or rubber products benefit from the biocompatible, non-toxic and chemically inert protective barrier that Parylene coatings provide.
 
        The Parylene coating is applied through a vapor deposition process in a vacuum chamber and during the coating process the Parylene monomer is able to penetrate the surface of rubbers and plastics providing exceptional adhesion. Parylene’s thin, transparent and flexible characteristics enhance the performance of rubber and elastomer components by protecting surfaces and modifying surface properties. These improvements are made without degrading the functional performance of the part. Parylene yields a truly conformal coated part with a consistent thickness on the flat surface area and around the internal dimensions of holes. Pinhole-free parylene coating can prevent the transfer of substances into or out of a coated substrate, even in one or two micron layers. Parylene conformal coatings seal micro porosity and encapsulate the most complex typographies, providing protection against potential leachable ingredients in the elastomer product.`,

        detail: `As medical devices become smaller and more compact, the use of Parylene coatings finds increasing value due to its molecular level deposition. Thin film, pinhole-free Parylene conformal coatings provide the ultimate protection for life-saving devices and instruments in the medical industry. Inert, vacuum deposited Parylene is biocompatible and biostable and offers excellent dry-film lubricity, thermal stability, moisture, chemical and dielectric barrier protection. Additionally, Parylene is FDA-approved (with a USP XXII, Class VI biocompatibility rating) and is safe for use within the body.

        Parylene is a thin, vacuum-deposited polymer. It differs from conventional coatings in that it is deposited on objects at room temperature as a film, and does not use solvents, catalysts, plasticizers, or other feature-enhancing additives. It is based on a high-purity raw material called di-paraxylylene, which is a white, crystalline powder. A vacuum and thermal process converts the powder to a polymer film, which is formed on substrates at room temperature.`,

        detail: `Parylene coatings protect a wide array of medical devices and components including stents, catheters, pacemakers, electrosurgical tools, epidural probes, mandrels, needles, and more. Medical devices used in surgical procedures are selectively coated with Parylene to improve their lubricity and to provide selective electrical insulation. The coating also protects and lubricates hypodermic needles and can create a biocompatible barrier on implantable devices and prosthetic hardware. Parylene’s unique properties include precise conformance to substrate topography, pinhole-free coverage in very thin layers, and the ability to penetrate and coat complex surfaces. Parylene film resists chemical attack from organic solvents, inorganic reagents, and acids; it adheres well to many surfaces, and offers exceptional dielectric strength. Parylene has a lubricious surface, with a coefficient of friction which approaches that of PTFE (Teflon).
        Parylene is the ideal choice for most types of substrates including glass, ceramics, plastics, metals, elastomers and silicone rubber. Parylene’s optically clear coatings have the ability to conform to any shape such as sharp edges and points. Parylene does not promote the growth of biologics. Its surface is unsuitable for the proliferation of bacteria and other pathogens. `,

        title: "Conformal Coating for Printed Circuit Boards",
        detail: `Printed circuit boards (PCB) generally perform well electrically, but performance will quickly deteriorate due to environmental variables such as temperature, dirt, dust, debris and moisture. Accidental impacts, power overloads and power surges can be severely detrimental to your printed circuit boards as well.  All these factors and more will degrade your PCB in a gradual manner, corroding it and reducing its reliability and longevity.  In order to avoid these problems, manufacturers and engineers turn to conformal coating to provide protection against the environment.
        
        Conformal coating is a protective non-conductive dielectric layer that is typically applied by spraying, dipping or brushing onto the PCB assembly to protect it from damage caused by harsh or extreme environments.  Additionally, conformal coating will prolong the life of the product during its operation and prevent damage from installation, rough handling, and reduction of mechanical and thermal stress.
        When protecting a PCB, it’s important to choose a conformal coating that will offer good electrical properties, good chemical resistance, good thermal properties, low moisture permeability and mechanical durability.  The ideal conformal coating will adhere well to board materials and the components that populate the board.`,

        title2:"Printed Circuit Boards",
        detail: `There are several different masking techniques using different materials such as masking tape, dots, shapes, boots and liquid latex in conformal coating processing. The masking requirements for liquid applications and Parylene coated PCBs differ in that Parylene masking must be ‘airtight’ and properly ‘sealed’ while liquid masking is basically a ‘shield’ from the liquid. An exception would be PCBs being processed via the dip method. These masked areas need to be sealed to the PCB to prevent the leakage of any unwanted coating into the connectors. However, if the masking fails or rework becomes necessary there are approved methods of coating removal.
        
        Conformal Coating Limitations:
        Conformal coatings do have their limitations and their performance can be hindered by contamination coming from fingerprints, flux residues, moisture and other atmospheric pollutants present on the PCB surface before the coating is sealed in during the process.  Therefore, it’s extremely important that PCBs are always cleaned and dried before the coating is applied to ensure efficient long term performance.`,
