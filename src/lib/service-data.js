        title2: "What is Parylene ?",
        detail2: `Parylene is a common generic name for a unique series of polymers based on paraxylene. The Parylenes are formed by the pyrolysis of a di-p-xylene (dimer) in a vacuum environment which is then deposited on the cooler, room temperature substrate within the vacuum chamber. Parylene is applied in a vacuum as a gas that disperses evenly throughout the chamber to target surfaces the material forms as a clear polymer (plastic) film.
          Conformal coatings are generally applied in a liquid phase by spraying, dipping, or brushing. Parylene materials form linear, highly-crystalline polymers can be usefully produced only as coatings and films. The resulting film is thin and highly conformal, has no pinholes, can completely encapsulate a substrate to protect it from many conditions such as environmental attack, moisture, chemicals, fungus, dirt and dust
          The applications for Parylene coatings are far-reaching and include military devices, automotive parts, circuit boards, elastomers, O-rings and medical implants. (Parylene is biocompatible and FDA approved). In addition, Parylene is electrically insulating, make it perfect for LED signage, which requires lightweight coating that will protect electrical components from the elements. The defect-free coating, once solidified, is as invisible to the eye and is up to 100 times thinner than a human hair. Parylene typically ranges in thickness from 0.25-1 mil.`,

Both formulations provide excellent humidity resistance and far greater chemical resistance than Acrylic coatings. Single component Polyurethanes, while easy to apply, enjoy long pot life but sometimes require very lengthy cure cycles to achieve full or optimum cure. In some instances, the cure cycle can be accelerated by the judicious application of heat.
        Two component formulations can reach optimum cure properties in as little as one to three hours with the assistance of heat. However, when compared to single component formulations, two-component formulas can have a relatively short pot life sometimes making them difficult to work with. Removal of Polyurethane coatings can be difficult due to their very high resistance to solvents. For single-components, the preferred method of removal is via burn through for spot repair, while the use of specially formulated strippers enables the user to completely remove the coating from an entire PCB assembly for more wide-ranging rework concerns. These products do not necessarily represent our complete Urethanes range. Mil-I-46058C and IPC-CC-830 approved.`,
